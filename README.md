  - Objective
  - 
      The objective of Blackjack Roguelike is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total of 21.


  - Gameplay

      Starting Hand: You and the dealer are dealt two cards each. Your cards are face-up, while the dealer's first card is face-down.

      Player's Turn: You have the option to "Hit" (receive another card) or "Stand" (keep your current hand). You can also use special cards if you have any.

      Dealer's Turn: Once you decide to stand, the dealer reveals their face-down card and hits until their hand total is 17 or higher.

      Outcome: If your hand total is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21, you win. If your hand exceeds 21, you bust and lose the round.

  - Special Cards

      Special cards add unique effects to the game.
